You awaken
The sun blinds you as you open your eyes and see trees all around you
A squirrel runs across your chest and you sit up
You check your pockets
You have a rock and a hammer
You are wearing a green shirt and blue tattered trousers
Standing up you see a beautiful forest and mountain range
A path is ahead of you with a sign on it
You can't make out what it says

Above all the signs it says

==Welcome to Hikomori==
